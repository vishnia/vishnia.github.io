This is a page where I will write about my experiments with Google Analytics.
==

Overview
===

Today, I setup my first analytics testing account, and add the tracking code to my site. There won't be much traffic, but that's ok. I just needed a site and an account, so that I could have some data to actually view in the analytics dashboard.

Description
===

I recently took my Google Analytics IQ exam and passed with an 88%. I was really happy about this, as I am trying to change my career with a move into analytics.
